# SQL PERFORMANCE:

 - Use EXISTS instead of IN to check existence of data.
 - Avoid * in SELECT statement. Give the name of columns which you require.
 - Use joins instead of sub-queries.
 - Use WHERE expressions to limit the size of result tables that are created with joins.
 

# SQL DATA STORAGE:
 
 - Size matters
	Always use the smallest data size that will accommodate the largest possible value. 
	If a column is going to store values between 1 and 5, use tinyint instead of int.

- Faster sorts
	To speed up frequent sorts, use an int (or an integer-based) data type if possible. 
	SQL Server sorts integer data faster than character data.
	
- Efficient strings
	The text data type accommodates a lot of data but at a cost. 
	Unfortunately, I have seen developers use it by default. 
	For those large columns, use varchar instead; it accommodates up to 8,000 
	characters and requires less overhead. Consequently, varchar performs better.
